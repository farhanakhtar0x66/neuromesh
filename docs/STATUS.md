# Status and handoff

Kept current after every meaningful step so that work can resume in a new
session if usage runs out. Read this first, then `docs/02-v0.1-plan.md`.

## Standing instructions from the owner (2026-11-11)

- Work through M2 to M6 without asking for confirmation.
- Commit and push to `origin main` (private repo `farhanakhtar0x66/neuromesh`)
  often, including between milestones.
- Workers and testers: Gemini 3.8 Flash through Antigravity (`agy`). Gemini quota
  is plentiful; use it for all development runs.
- Expert (orchestrator, escalation) model, in this order:
  1. Claude Opus 4.6 / Sonnet 4.6 through Antigravity (until 2026-11-18)
  2. `gpt-6.1-sol` at medium or high effort through Codex
  3. Claude Opus 5.5 at medium effort through Claude Code, only if both above are exhausted

## Where things stand

| Milestone | State |
| --- | --- |
| M0 backend conformance | Done. See `docs/03-m0-results.md`. |
| M1 single agent, prompt to applied diff | Done. 5/5 live tasks, both kill and Ctrl-C resume pass. See `docs/04-m1-results.md`. |
| M2 task suite and baselines | 20 tasks in `evals/tasks`, `neuromesh eval` done. `base-solo-flash` running. `base-solo-opus46` paused after 5/5 passes: Opus 4.6 on Antigravity hit its individual quota after ~600k tokens; rerun the same command to continue once it resets. |
| M3 orchestrator and workers | Engine done (`src/engine/run.ts`), 45 tests. First live `factory` eval on the multi-part tasks running (`try-factory-multi`). |
| M4 tester, repair, escalation | Built into the same engine: tester, review fixes, stagnation breaker, escalation autopsy, model fallback. Needs live measurement. |
| M5 intake and parallel work | Built: intake rules (`src/intake`), parallel scheduler with owned-path overlap, conflict redo, integration fix. Needs live measurement with `maxParallel` > 1. |
| M6 hardening and release | Not started |

## How to resume

```bash
cd ~/Projects/neuromesh && git pull && npm install
```

```bash
npm test && npx tsc --noEmit
```

Live checks (spend Gemini quota only):

```bash
node src/cli/main.ts eval --preset solo-flash --tasks js-slugify-bug,rust-roman --name smoke
```

```bash
node evals/kill-resume.ts --signal SIGKILL
```

Run state lives in `~/.neuromesh/projects/<repo>-<id>/runs/`; eval output in
`~/.neuromesh/evals/`.

## Eval commands in use

```bash
node src/cli/main.ts eval --preset solo-flash --name base-solo-flash
```

```bash
node src/cli/main.ts eval --preset solo-opus46 --name base-solo-opus46
```

```bash
node src/cli/main.ts eval --preset factory --kinds multi --name try-factory-multi
```

```bash
node src/cli/main.ts eval compare base-solo-flash base-solo-opus46 try-factory-multi
```

Rerunning an eval command with the same `--name` continues it; tasks already
finished are skipped.
